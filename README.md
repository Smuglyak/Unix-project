<h2>We are doing a project where we create a VPS server and deploy the webserver which will show our website with some web pages. </h2>

# Project goals:

### Create a VPS which will serve as a website containing several web pages of the popular computer game Dota 2

# <img align="left"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smuglyak/Unix-project/main/images/settings.png"  alt="img"  width="50px"/> Platform choice:

- Google Cloud VPS and Apache Server

# <img align="left"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smuglyak/Unix-project/main/images/to-do-list.png"  alt="img"  width="50px"/> Requirements:

1. Set up multiple accounts: The server host will create accounts using the terminal and so that the other users will be able to connect using those accounts.

1. Process the service management: We will check for updates on the services that we

used by software such as cacti, mrtg, or Munin.

1. Basic Security System: Configure the server to make it HTTPS. Also, generate SSH keys for security and easiness to connect to the server.

1. Automated Tasks: Write a script to pull new files from GitHub and put them automatically on the server

_Chosen Software:_

Distro: Ubuntu

Hardware Platform; Google Cloud services

Software: WinSCP, Apache

_The reasons why we chose those software programs:_
Google Cloud services: Honestly, I chose GCP because I was able to understand the GCP faster than AWS and Azure. And the free 300$ credits each month is a benefit. I can still use the VPS for another two months but that's it.

Ubuntu: Our project consists of a static website that doesn't have that much complexity. We could honestly use any distro to run a webserver with our website, but we chose Ubuntu because of our personal preference. Plus, Ubuntu itself is a popular and stable distro that updates itself every 6 months. So, a pretty reliable OS.

Apache: Honestly, this was a no-brainer. There would be no different for our project to use Nginx or Apache since our web server won't be having too much web traffic, and there would be no difference in loading up our website fastly. Right now, people care about the speed of loading up the websites, and in our case, there would have been not that much difference using Nginx or Apache.

WinSCP: We used WinSCP file transfer software because we could ssh key through that application but not on the FileZilla. That is the only reason we used the WinSCP.

# <img align="left"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smuglyak/Unix-project/main/images/schedule.png"  alt="img"  width="50px"/> Timeline:

Week 12 – Edit Team Project Proposal, work on the journal, create the Git repository and choose the VPS provider.

Week 13 – Request the service from the VPS provider, create the webserver using the Web

Server Software and create multiple accounts.

Week 14 – Create the basic security system for the Web Server and make a script that

automates tasks in the Web Server.

Week 15 – Finish the project and prepare for Oral Presentation.
